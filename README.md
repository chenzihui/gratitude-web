# What is this
----------------------------------------

This repository contains the Ember.js web client of a Gratitude Journal app that
uses the [API found here](http://github.com/chenzihui/gratitude-api).

## Installing dependencies
----------------------------------------

To start, begin by running `npm install` and `bower install` to make sure you have
Ember.js and other libraries that we're using for the application.

After which, run `gulp dev` and visit `http://localhost:4000` to see the app.

Note that this application is still under heavy development and there will be
a lot of changes in the coming weeks.

## TODO
